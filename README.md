# Arduino_Archive
Soooo I've decided to delve a little bit into Embedded Systems and Robotics. Well, specifically into Arduino Electronics. At first, it was solely just for me to get on a level head for my Thesis, but then I realized...wait, this is kinda fun!

These aren't big projects just yet, but it's a learning step. This is going to be a collective archive of all the Arduino sketches I've made so far to get a grasp on the basics of Arduino

Whether it's small systems or big modules, any type of entry is welcome.
