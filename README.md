# Arduino_Archive
Okayyy soooo I've decided to delve a little bit into Electronics / Embedded Systems /Robotics. Well, specifically into Arduino Electronics. At first, it was solely just for me to get on a level head for my Thesis (it still is to some extent, lmao) but then I realized...wait, this is kinda fun! I've been studying CpE for the longest time and I haven't had the chance to actually handle an Arduino microcontroller. Welp, that changes today. These aren't going to be big projects just yet, but it's an initial learning step. This is going to be a collective archive of all the Arduino sketches and programs that I've made so far in order to get a grasp on the basics of Arduino. The limitations of this learning segment are up to the components provided within the learning kit (please refer to the given image below):

Regardless, that's not going to stop me from trying to get a hands-on experience with the Arduino Uno microcontroller, as well as various component interfacing methods. Whether it's small systems or big modules, any type of entry is welcome.I have a BIG feeling that this'll be useful later on. Eitherway, there's only one way to find out. Let's do this!
